- 👋 Hi, I’m @sraz001 and I am have a Bs.C in Comuputer Science and a MA in Business.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Golang, JavaScript development - as a hobby, not my day to day work, althought some of my projects do involve software that I use for finance related work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang in a more detailed level, being very proficient in Python and somewhat in JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various opensource projects
